## Interests

I play board games, table top roleplaying games and video games with friends and my wife. I've got a kayaking qualification, and also enjoy boxing and weightlifting classes. I frequently take part in live action roleplaying events (LARP) throughout the UK and have helped run a couple of LARP events. I also enjoy travelling, with my most recent countries of call in the last couple of years Japan, Portugal and Canada.
