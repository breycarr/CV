## Ben Reynolds-Carr

I'm a full stack developer who is inquisitive and adaptable. I'm looking for a role that lets me use my problem-solving skills proactively. 

I worked for three years as a contractor in financial services and four years as an Human Resources Administrator in the not-for-profit sector, and my roles frequently had me exploring new software. Now I want a chance to be a part of an industry that provides people with creative solutions to their daily tasks.

## Interests

I play board games, table top roleplaying games and video games with friends and my wife. I've got a kayaking qualification, and also enjoy boxing and weightlifting classes. I frequently take part in live action roleplaying events (LARP) throughout the UK and have helped run a couple of LARP events. I also enjoy travelling, with my most recent countries of call in the last couple of years Japan, Portugal and Canada.
