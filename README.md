## Ben Reynolds-Carr

I'm a full stack developer looking for a role that lets me use my problem-solving skills proactively.

Coming from a background in financial services and human resources, my roles frequently had me exploring new software. For the last year I have been teaching myself to code via online resources, culminating in my decision to join the selective Maker's Academy bootcamp

I am now looking for a career that lets me work on interesting new projects and continue to learn.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|-|-|-|
| [Deep_Root](https://github.com/breycarr/deep_root) | Makers final project. As a team, we were tasked with making a hardware product. We developed a soil moisture sensor with an integrated desktop app run off touchscreen | Raspberry Pi, Python, Pytest, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Eel, Travis CI |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/samkitchen94/acebook-rails-amoeba-boyz) | A team project to build a Facebook clone with continuous integration and deployment | Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Travis CI, RSpec, Capybara |
| [Notes](https://github.com/breycarr/notes) | A team project in which our task was to write a pure JavaScript app with no libraries and a custom built testing framework. The single page web app takes and displays notes | JavaScript, HTML |
| [RPS Challenge](https://github.com/breycarr/rps-challenge) | An independent project to build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors web app | Ruby, RSpec, Capybara, Sinatra |
| [Countdown](https://github.com/breycarr/countdown) | A personal project to write a program that creates and solves shuffled letter puzzles | Ruby |

## Skills

#### Great communicator and collaborator.

- During Makers I made sure I was being an effective and communicative pair partner and team member by sharing what I was working on throughout the day and making my team aware of anything new and useful that I had learned. I also made sure to clearly communicate potential blockers, as well as those that came up throughout the day
- As an HR professional, I was responsible for communicating policy information across businesses from operations to top level management
- I completed a one day Communication Skills Course with Impact Factory in April 2017, with a focus on active listening and conflict resolution

#### Fast, independent learner

- I started teaching myself to code in summer 2018, using Codecademy courses
- Before the Makers Academy precourse began, I developed my own basic CLI projects, such as [Countdown](https://github.com/breycarr/countdown)
- Throughout the Makers course, I learned how to apply object oriented programming processes, and adapt them across multiple languages.
- This was used effectively when my team and I learned Python and the Pytest framework in less than a week in order to develop software that took readings from a soil sensor and changed light colours based on the soil moisture.
- In my personal life, I play a lot of social games, and I'm able to quickly learn the mechanics of a game in order to explain them to others.

#### Methodical approach to problem solving and debugging

- I'm effective at understanding and finding solutions to error messages during TDD and debugging, and understanding the reasons why errors occur.
- In order to have a clear process, I created a [language agnostic debugging process diagram](https://github.com/breycarr/misc_files/blob/master/Debugging%20Process.jpg), which focuses on gaining visibility of the issue and closing the loop on where it occurs.
- During my final project at Makers Academy, I applied this process to [debugging hardware](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s/debugging-hardware-by-ben-82c38ada24bc)

## Interests

I play board games, table top roleplaying games and video games with friends and my wife. I've got a kayaking qualification, and also enjoy boxing and weightlifting.

I frequently take part in live action roleplaying events (LARP) throughout the UK and have helped run a couple of LARP events.

I also enjoy travelling, most recently travelling to Japan, Portugal and Canada in the last couple of years
