## Ben Reynolds-Carr

I'm a full stack developer looking for a role that lets me use my problem-solving skills proactively.

Coming from a background in financial services and human resources, my roles frequently had me exploring new software. For the last year I have been teaching myself to code via online resources, culminating in my decision to join the selective Maker's Academy bootcamp

I am now looking for a career that lets me work on interesting new projects and continue to learn.

## Projects

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2019 to July 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code. [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]
- Fast, independent learner. Throughout the Makers course, I learned how to apply object oriented programming processes, and adapt them across multiple languages. This was used effectively when I learned Python and the Pytest framework in less than a week in order to develop software that took readings from a soil sensor and changed light colours based on the soil moisture. In my personal life, I play a lot of board games, and I'm able to quickly learn the mechanics of a game in order to explain them to others.
- Great collaborator [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]

- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban)
- XP Values
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Python
- RSpec, Jasmine, Pytest

I play board games, table top roleplaying games and video games with friends and my wife. I've got a kayaking qualification, and also enjoy boxing and weightlifting.

I also enjoy travelling, most recently travelling to Japan, Portugal and Canada in the last couple of years
